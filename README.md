# my-hyprland-config
Incase of explosion...

Just my sane setup, not sure if hyprbars is auto starting as recently disabled

Actually can't remember what scheme is/does :)

Notes for self:

Put rofi.rasi in .local/share/rofi/themes/

Put one-dark-pro-theme/ in ~/.config/kitty/

MKDIR 'one-dark-pro-theme' in ~/.config/kitty

put 123.conf in ''./kitty/one-dark-pro-theme'

edit kitty.conf to include '123.conf'

so annoying!
